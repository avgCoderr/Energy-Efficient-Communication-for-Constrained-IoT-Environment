## Title
Energy-Efficient Communication for Constrained IoT Environment

## Description
In the realm of the Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks, two key concerns are improving security and energy efficiency. One approach to enhancing network longevity is through the implementation of clustering, which involves managing cluster heads. A cluster head is a specialized node responsible for aggregating data from its cluster members. The election of a cluster head is a crucial step in network management. In this particular study, we propose a novel algorithm from the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) family. Additionally, we have developed a MATLAB simulation environment to assess the performance of various Cluster Head algorithms. In this simulation, we will be testing LEACH and its available variants with Proposed variants of LEACH on various network factors like operating nodes, number of clusters, transmission energy, and more. These comparisons will give us a crucial insight into the working of our Proposed algorithm and question its applicability in the real world. The results of this comparison are promising, as the Proposed variant of LEACH is successful in keeping the network alive for more than twice the rounds as the variants of LEACH.

## Getting Started

There are three types of MATLAB files provided in the repository:

1. New MATLAB code files for all the algorithms (LEACH, LEACH-C, LEACH-HEED, LEACH-RB, LEACH-RB with Degree) in folder "New Files".

2. Old MATLAB code files for all the algorithms (LEACH, LEACH-C, LEACH-HEED, LEACH-RB, LEACH-RB with Degree) in folder "Old Files".

3. Combined MATLAB code file called "leach_comparison.m" which can be used to compare the performance of all the algorithms in a single run.
